<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Type of graph: This is a scatter plot with a line graph superimposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Description of data: These data are from MOMA, and include information about pieces in the collection, including artist, year made and year obtained, and dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Description of audience: This would be an audience interested in art and interested in the Moma collection. It could also be relevant to museum curators of how to display pieces. There are clearly a number of very wide pieces over tall, so it may be optimal to reserve large horizontal spaces of wall for these pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Representation Description: I am trying to show the distribution of dimensions of paintings in the Moma collection. It is colored based on dimensionality, with dimension orientation highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p>How to read it &amp; What to look for: Notice that while there are dimension differences, the line highlights that many fall within similar aspect ratios, whether theyâ€™re portrait or landscape oriented. In addition, there are more very wide pieces than very tall, and the widest pieces are longer than the height of the tallest pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation tips: Annotation could be added to highlight specific pieces of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Variations and alternatives: A density plot could be an interesting alternative, as it would demonstrate key dimensions that are popular.</p></li>
<li><p>Methods: For this graph I extracted the dimensions of all paintings and converted to feet. Then I plotted height against width. Finally I originally added regression lines for the dimensions but that did not look like the original so I instead created artificial lines to approximate the regression lines. Finally I added annotations and colored by dimension.</p></li>
